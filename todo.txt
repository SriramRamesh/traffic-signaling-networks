given a traffic curve bunch a parame4ter we can predict next 3-4 hrs

what variation of burst can best expln

3 var to estimate
3 non linear eqns

burst rate in the traffic curve that can expln output exit rate

current status of the n/w
speed => buffer occupancy
Q: what is the next burst rate that can expln (t+1) buffer occupancy?

last 2 hrs => buffer rate
